# data_analysis_rstudio

Presented projects from my 2-years "R for data analytics" course. 

Each project contains:
- report.rmd, 
- report.html, 
- dashboard.rmd,
- dashboard.html. 

Notes in files are mostly in russian as the course was conducted in russian. 
But code and visualization allows to understand the sense of analysis.
